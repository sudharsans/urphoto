This consent policy outlines how we use your selfie to search and identify your own photos among event photos.

                                    <li>Collection and Usage of Selfie: By providing your consent, you authorize UrPhoto AI to collect, process, and use your selfie for the sole purpose of searching and identifying your own photos from all event photos available on our platform. Your selfie will only be used for the intended purpose and will not be shared or disclosed to any third parties without your explicit consent.</li>
                                    <li>Storage and Retention: We will securely store your selfie on our servers for the duration required to perform the photo search process. Afterward, we will promptly delete or anonymize your selfie, unless you explicitly grant us permission to retain it for future use or if required by applicable laws or regulations.</li>
                                    <li>Facial Recognition Technology: UrPhoto AI uses facial recognition technology to analyze the features of your selfie in order to compare and match them with other photos available on our platform. This technology allows us to provide you with a personalized experience by identifying and presenting your own event photos more accurately.</li>
                                    <li>Security Measures: We employ industry-standard security measures to protect your personal information, including your selfie, from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, it is important to note that no data transmission over the internet or electronic storage method is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</li>
                                    <li>Opt-out and Withdrawal of Consent: You have the right to withdraw your consent for using your selfie to search for your own photos at any time. To do so, please contact our customer support or follow the instructions provided in our platform settings. It&#39;s important to note that withdrawing your consent may limit or prevent the functionality of certain features or services on our platform.</li>
                                    <li>Third-Party Sharing: We do not share your personal photos, including your selfie, with any third parties, except as required by law or with your explicit consent. We do not sell or rent your personal information to any third parties for marketing purposes.</li>
                                    <li>Compliance with Applicable Laws: We comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations governing the collection, usage, and protection of personal information. We continuously review and update our practices to ensure ongoing compliance and adherence to privacy best practices.</li>
